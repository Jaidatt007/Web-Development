        <h2>Technology</h2>
            <p>Technology and its influence on society are common themes in Iron Man stories,[29][145] 
                and various writers have portrayed him as a technological marvel since his earliest 
                appearances.[146] The character's use of technology, both as a weapons manufacturer and 
                as Iron Man, explores problems that arise from progress and advancement,[147] including 
                misuse of technology and the implications of cybernetics.[148] Iron Man's position 
                within the suit allows for discussion regarding automation versus human oversight of 
                technology,[149] and it reflects the debate on how new technologies are incorporated 
                into public and military use, including the use of exoskeletons and battle suits.[150] 
                These technological themes are explored through a modern lens during the "Extremis" 
                story arc, which incorporates the idea of human enhancement through biotechnology.</p>

        <h2>Armor</h2>
                <p>Iron Man does not have any superhuman abilities. Instead, he derives his strength 
                    from a powered armor of his own design.[159] The armor is equipped with various 
                    weapons, which include "repulsor rays" in each palm that project particle beams as 
                    well as a stronger "unibeam" on his chest.[99] As of 2010, Marvel described 
                    Iron Man's armor as being able to lift 100 tons and to fly at Mach 8.[99]
                    <br>
                    Marvel initially depicted the armor as powered by transistors,[18] but this was 
                    replaced with integrated circuits as real-world technology advanced.[160] 
                    New designs have further miniaturized the technology, ultimately incorporating 
                    nanotechnology.[161] Developments in the armor's design often reflect real-world 
                    advances in technology and trends in science fiction.[162] The changing nature of 
                    the armor allows artists to make frequent changes to the character's appearance 
                    without controversy.[145] Iron Man has also created specialized models for specific 
                    purposes,[163] including space armor, stealth armor, and deep sea armor,[164] as 
                    well as the Hulkbuster armor to engage in combat with the Hulk.[163]</p>
